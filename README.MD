# CENG310 Programming Assignment 3: Uncovering Celestial Messages using Hash Tables

## Overview
This assignment involves using hash tables to decode messages hidden within celestial patterns, aiming to simulate a system that could potentially communicate with future humans or civilizations. By implementing various hash functions and handling collisions, students will explore the practical applications of hash tables in managing and decoding large sets of data efficiently.


## Usage
Explain how to use the system:
- **Starting the program**: Provide the command to start the program.
- **Input files**: Describe how to use or modify the provided `CelestialMessagesInitialization.dat` file.
- **Operations**: Detail how to perform insertions, deletions, and searches within the hash table system.

## Implementation Details
- **Hash Functions**:
- Describe the primary and secondary hash functions used.
- Explain any specific choices in the design of these functions.
- **Collision Handling**:
- Discuss the implementation of double hashing and how collisions are managed.
- Mention the use of tombstones and their role in maintaining the integrity of the hash table.
- **Resizing the Hash Table**:
- Explain under what conditions the hash table is resized and how rehashing is handled.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Outline how to perform unit testing. 

## Possible Improvements
Discuss any potential improvements that could be made to the hash functions or other aspects of the hash table implementation. This could involve:
- Enhancements to the efficiency of hash functions.
- Alternative methods for collision handling and resizing.
- Optimizations in the storage and retrieval processes.
